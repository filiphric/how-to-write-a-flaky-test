<!-- 

- going back to the three axes of test automation, I think it is valuable to look at the type of flakiness you are dealing with
- whether it’s sourced by the rising number of tests (x-axis), the way how they are executed (y-axis) or simply by performence of the automation script (z-axis) flakiness should be something to be always watched for
- [click] lastly, don’t forget about the fact, that you are trying to integrate two systems together, and that test automation is in essence a challenge of making sure that your test and your app play well together
